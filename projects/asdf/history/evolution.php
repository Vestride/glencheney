<h1>The Evolution of UNIX</h1>

<p>
UNIX was originally written in assembly language, 
but was soon converted into C by Dennis Ritchie allowing 
for the operating system to be much more easily ported 
to other types of computers. UNIX went through many other 
developers, some being corporations, and some being 
universities. Some notable developers were the Berkeley 
of the University of California and Sun Microsystems. 
These two developers, amongst other things, added strong 
networking capability to UNIX.

From the start, UNIX was a system built largely through 
the open-source method, even though it was licensed for
 most of it's life under Bell Labs. It emerged as a 
 surprisingly simplistic operating system with basic 
 text editing, a unique file management system, adaptability, 
 and easy portability between machines. Now, it is used 
 primarily for internet servers, as a great manager of 
 files and great networking capability.
