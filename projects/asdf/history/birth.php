<h1>The Birth of UNIX</h1>
<p>
UNIX is an operating system that was quite unique when it came out, 
and even more unique for still being useful, even though it was originally 
developed a long time ago (compared to the lifetime of computers). 
UNIX was based off the less useful Multics operating system developed at 
MIT and first developed by Ken Thompson with help from Dennis Ritchie. 
Originally developed on an old PDP-7 minicomputer (as shown here).

UNIX was unique in many ways. It was originally built 
without real thinking of it's commercial applications, 
instead built to play the video game developed earlier 
by Ken and to give him a chance to try and design an OS 
to replace Multics. The new system would keep the ability 
of Multics to allow for computing on the go, instead of 
using the punch cards required for most other computers. 
UNIX was also built with a file storage system very similar 
to what you see in most modern PCs, which was much more useful 
than previous systems. After the groundwork was laid, UNIX 
was also developed hugely in part by many volunteers, largely 
due in part to the emergence of the proto-internet and a lack 
of prosecution by Bell Labs allowing for many bootleg copies.
