<h1>Uploading Files</h1>


<p>
One of the most popular (and free) programs used for 
uploading and downloading your files to the server is 
FileZilla. FileZilla is an FTP client, meaning it's a 
program that transfers files. The following instructions are 
for FileZilla, but most FTP clients look similar. 
If you do not have an FTP client, FileZilla is a great 
choice; we have a link to the download page 
in our "resources" section.
</p>

<p>
To use it, you enter your host/server, username, password and 
port 22 and then click "Quickconnect" (Box 1).<br />
You should see your computer's drives on the left (Box 2) and after 
clicking on one of the drives, you should be able to see the files and 
folders on that drive (Box 3).<br />
On the right, you should see the host/server's folder structure (Box 4) and
the files in the highlighted folder (Box 5).

You can navigate your file structure by using the tree structure 
or double clicking on your folders. When you have found the file 
you want to upload (also called Put), you can right click and 
select upload, or drag and drop from your local files to the 
remote files. Downloading (Get) remote files is just as 
easy, you can right click and select download, double 
click the file, or drag and drop it to your local files.

<p>
You can set permissions through UNIX like we taught you, 
or you can right-click a file on the server and select "File permissions".
</p>

<p>
You can either check off the boxes in the file permissions 
dialog box, or you can just type in the numeric 
permissions you want.
