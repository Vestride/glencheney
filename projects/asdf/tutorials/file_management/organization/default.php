<h1>File Organization</h1>
<p>
Now you have a UNIX account populated with files.  At some point, you'll want to organize them, so they're easier to use.
Maybe you want a file put into a different folder, or you want to copy it somewhere.  Perhaps you don't need a file or directory 
anymore, and want to get rid of it.  All of this is contained within.
