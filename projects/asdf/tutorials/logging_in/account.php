<h1>Your Account</h1>
<p>
If this is your first time logging in, you might have been given a 
default password. It would be a good idea to change it to something 
that you can easily remember. UNIX also may periodically require 
you to change it for security reasons.
</p>
<p>
To change your password, type in <span style="font-family:courier">
passwd</span>. You will be required to type in your old password 
for security reasons (which, again, you will not see). 
UNIX will then prompt you to enter your new password twice to 
make sure you don't mess up.
<object> 
<div class="shellwindow">
server{username}: passwd<br />
Enter old password:<br />
<br />
Enter new password:<br />
<br />
Retype new password:<br />
</div></object><br />
Some UNIX systems have a minimum 
password length or require numbers or special symbols. The system 
won't accept a password that is too short or that doesn't have 
the required variety of characters.

<p>
On most UNIX systems every user has their own directory (folder), 
usually with the name of their username. It also is usually the 
default directory you are in when you log in (more on navigating 
directories later in the tutorial). Inside this folder is where 
you will do almost all of your work in UNIX.
