<h1>FTP</h1>
<p>
There are several good, free FTP programs for download. 
For Windows, you can use <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">
SmartFTP</a>, <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, 
or <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>. 
For Mac, you can use <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">
FileZilla</a>, <a href="http://fetchsoftworks.com/">Fetch</a> 
(not free), or <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a>. 
Linux runs many, the most prevalent of which is 
<a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. You can 
also get a cross-platform addon for Firefox, called 
<a href="http://fireftp.mozdev.org/">FireFTP</a>.
Since FileZilla runs on all three, that is the one we will introduce you to.
</p>
<p>
When you run FileZilla, you will see a Quickconnect bar at the top, 
a list of the files on your computer on the left, and a blank space 
off to the right where the files on the server will be shown.

<div style="text-align:center" >

<img style="border:0;" src="quickconnect_small.jpg" alt="Quickconnect Screenshot" /><br />

</object>
</p>
<p> 
In the Quickconnect bar, enter the server you wish to connect to, 
the username and password you have or were given, and the port number. 
If you are using regular FTP, use port 21. If you are using SFTP use port 22. 
If you are unsure, try port 22 first, and if that doesn't work use port 21. 
</p>
<p>
If you successfully connected, you should see a list of the files on the 
server in the righthand panel. You can move around the file structure 
just like you do in your local files that are physically on your computer. 
You can download any file on the server and upload any file to the 
server from your computer. To learn more about this go to our
