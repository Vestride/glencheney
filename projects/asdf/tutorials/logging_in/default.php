Every webpage you see on the internet is retrieved from a computer somewhere. 
How did those files get there? Did someone stick a USB drive into them and 
save the files to the hard drive? The answer to that is no. What they did 
is connect remotely to the UNIX machine storing those webpages, and uploaded 
them. We will be covering in the following tutorial the different ways to connect, 
so YOU can upload your webpages to UNIX and make them available on the internet.
