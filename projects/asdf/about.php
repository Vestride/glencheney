<h2>Allison Carnwath - Team Leader</h2>
<p>
Hi, I'm Alli.  I'm a New Media Interactive Development major, 
minoring in Computer Science and Digital Business, and concentrating in American Sign Language.  
I'm taking twenty credits this quarter and the next, and can't see anything over the pile of homework 
that I have yet to do.  Busy, busy, busy... gotta go!

<h2>Glen Cheney - Interaction Designer</h2>
<p>

Hi, I'm Glen, and only one of these is true. <br/><br/>
I'm half Australian and I enjoy eating wild kangaroos. I was born in Sydney, Australia, 
and I only came to the United States this fall. I have an awesome accent.

<h2>Stephanie Kalnoske - Artist</h2>
<p>
Color and contrast.  Concept and CSS.  These are the powers over which Stephanie holds her sway.

<h2>Josh Kramer - Programmer</h2>
<p>
Josh Kramer. Funny? Sure. Awesome at juggling at unicycling? Sure. Lives in Vermont 
when he's not at school at RIT as a tour guide, RA, webmaster of Running Club and Engineers 
for a Sustainable World? Sure. Superhuman flying powers? Probably not.

<h2>Bill Phillips - Information Designer</h2>
<p>
Bill Phillips is actually a robot piloted by three squirrels.  This only becomes a problem when they want to play
the video games they are learning to design, as only two can control the hands at a time.  He also has a question for you:
