			<h3>I decided =)</h3><br />
			I Just finished linking together the rest of the site with the new WordPress blog! I ended up copying the default Twenty Ten theme directory, renaming it, and doing some editing to get it to look like the rest of my site.<br />

			I don't know if I want to use WordPress for the front end too and make my own theme when I've already made my website theme. Kinda want to though. Then I can use the permalinks and all that other good stuff.<br />
<br />
			Tomorrow is my last day for my internship with Rokkan in New York City. I'm stoked to get home!<br /> ]]></description>

			In Place Of Kanye (Who Still Might Drop) G.O.O.D. Fridays, I Did A Remix Of Drake & Nicki Minaj's Song "Up All Night"<br />
<br />
			Because Kanye's Joints Are Wildly Popular And My Boy Yung Chad Does His Thing (Ash Wednesday) On Wednesdays, I've Decided To Put Myself Right In The Middle And Drop A New Track Every Week, Aptly Titled: "Thirsty Thursdays"<br />
<br />
			I Hope You Enjoy.<br />
<br />
			Lyrics:<br />
<br />
			Verse 1:<br />
<br />
			Kush Rolled, Glass Full, I Prefer Some Chicken Wings<br />
			Niggas With No Chicken Act Like Chicken Isn't Everything<br />
			I'm Having A Good Time, They Just Tryna Ruin It<br />
			I Don't Want It Fried, That's Why I'm Back Here BBQn It<br />
			Grill On, Top Down, Shake/Bake, Everytime<br />
			She Ain't Tryna Get That Chicken Kickin' Well Then Nevermind<br />
			I-I-I-I Tried To Tell You KFC Ain't Nothing Nice<br />
			Church's Sayin' You Should Quit<br />
			Popeye's Sayin' Fuck Your Life.<br />
			OK, Now We Outta Here, Toodles To Your Chicken<br />
			And If You're Italian, I Put Them Noodles With Yo Chicken, YEAH<br />
			I'm Busy Cookin' Shit. Tryna Stay Humble,<br />
			I Made Enough For Two Dinners, And Some Lunchables<br />
			Chicken Is A Drug, That I Can't Get Enough Of,<br />
			And I Never Stay Awake, Cause The ITIS Is Too Much,<br />
			I Got Hot Sauce In These Jeans, Just In Case You Ain't Get None<br />
			Son, My Chicken Gets It Poppin' Nigga This Is What I Does, AHH.<br />
<br />
			Chorus:<br />
<br />
			I'm About Whatever Man/Fuck What They Be Talking Bout/Put This Chicken In Your Mouth/You Won't Wanna Take It Out/NoOoOoOoOo/You Can't Do It Like We Do It/Grilled/Fried/Boiled/We Can Even BBQ It/I Be Up All Night/Whole Crew's In Here/[This] Finger Lickin' Chicken/And Some Booze In Here/oOoOoOoOo/Man I'd Love Some Greens/And Some Mac 'N Cheese/To Go Nice With My Chicken/oOoOoOoOo<br />
<br />
			Verse 2:<br />
<br />
			If Vinny Says Get Her, Then You Get Her<br />
			We Got That Kind Of Chicken, Makin' Turkey Bacon Bitter<br />
			We Got That Kind Of [W-W-Wait, Wait,] Fixate<br />
			Which Bitch You Know [Is] Eatin' Chicken Off Of This Plate<br />
			Chicken Is A Keep Sake<br />
			Bought The President Official Presidential  Cheap Plates<br />
			For Chicken On A Cheap Date<br />
			We Call 'Em Hawks, When We Eat Them In The Peach State<br />
			Man, For Pete's Sake, Chicken Tastes Great.<br />
			[Ah Ha Ha Ha Ha]<br />
			Fuck It Look Like Yo?<br />
			My Chicken? YES<br />
			Your Chicken? NO.<br />
			We Keep Them Bad Birds, But We Never Ever Mix Breeds,<br />
			Fuck A Diet, Eatin' Fried Chicken With Some Chick Peas.<br />
			And I Save Some For My Friends Too,<br />
			I See A Lot Of Bad Chicken On The Menu<br />
			So I Make Sure To Put It Down With Some Lentil,<br />
			And Pop Bottles With My Team<br />
			Eatin' Chicken Til The Death Of Me.<br />
<br />
			Chorus:<br />
<br />
			I'm About Whatever Man/Fuck What They Be Talking Bout/Put This Chicken In Your Mouth/You Won't Wanna Take It Out/NoOoOoOoOo/You Can't Do It Like We Do It/Grilled/Fried/Boiled/We Can Even BBQ It/I Be Up All Night/Whole Crew's In Here/[This] Finger Lickin' Chicken/And Some Booze In Here/oOoOoOoOo/Man I'd Love Some Greens/And Some Mac 'N Cheese/To Go Nice With My Chicken/oOoOoOoOo<br />
<br />
			Bridge:<br />
<br />
			I mean, we can't even eat that chicken if it don't got 'Purdue' near the price tag, you know?, I mean, I mean, but then again, who-who-who looks at brands like that? you know?<br />
			Chicken up in this bitch/OH/OH/OH/chicken up in this bitch/Oh/OH/OH.<br />

			<a href="http://webdesignledger.com/tips/bing-vs-google-a-usability-face-off">Bing vs Google: A Usability Face-Off by Jacob Creech</a><br/>We all know Google and Bing, and probably use one or both of them on more or less a daily basis.
