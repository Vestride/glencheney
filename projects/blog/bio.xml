                Hey, what's up, I'm Glen. I'm a New Media Interactive Development student at <a href="http://www.rit.edu">RIT</a>.
                I enjoy developing websites, hanging with friends, playing sports, listening to music, and tearing up Xbox LIVE with my crew.

                A brief history of me:
                <br />
                <br />
                I lived in Corvallis, Oregon all of my life. I was homeschooled by my mom until fifth grade. I went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Valley_High_School">Crescent Valley High School</a>, played baseball from the age of four until I injured my shoulder by getting hit from behind into the boards playing hockey.

                I played ice hockey from 7 until freshman year of RIT when I played for the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/clubhockey">club team</a>. I played lacrosse for the last two years of high school for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Corvallis-Lacrosse/184614569083">Corvallis Lacrosse</a>. By the way, go play lacrosse, it's way better than baseball.
                <br />

                I've always been interested in graphics and the web, thanks to Jake Likewise and Crescent Valley's Mr. Minyard.
