	<h2>Box Office</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the mostly negative critical reception, the film yielded an impressive turnout, as indicated by its box office figures. Revenge of the Fallen grossed $16 million on its midnight premiere, at the time, the most ever for a Wednesday midnight debut. The film proceeded to achieve the biggest Wednesday opening in history, bringing in $62 million in total receipts on its first day, additionally ranking it as the second-biggest opening day of all-time behind The Dark Knight. The film grossed $108.9 million on its first weekend, making it the biggest weekend gross of 2009 and the seventh-largest in history, and brought in $200 million in its first five days, putting it in second place behind the The Dark Knight's $203.7 million for all-time biggest five-day opening.

            Revenge of the Fallen remained #1 at the box office for two weeks straight, by a close margin.

Also, it was the first film of 2009 to reach the $300 million mark domestically.
