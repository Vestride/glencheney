Files were named with a version number at the end and if we remembered, that version number was updated when changes were made to it.</p>\n<p>This, however, was difficult to maintain and determine what the latest version of the plugin was.</p>\n<p>In 2013 and 2014, Odopod worked on two large projects: sony.com and store.google.com. Near the end of 2014 myself and a Senior Developer made a push to create an internal library of JavaScript components to keep track of all the great work we had done and improve it over time with the goal of eventually open-sourcing it.</p>\n<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª The private library</h2>\n<p>Our internal library, named Spark at the time, lived in private repositories on BitBucket and we used to Bower to manage the dependencies. Bower was still quite popular at the time for frontend libraries and it allowed any Odopod developer with access to the BitBucket repositories to install the packages via SSH.</p>\n<p>The dependencies in Bower looked something like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight" data-language="js">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token string">"dependencies"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>\n  <span class="token string">"spark-scroll-animation"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"git@bitbucket.org:redacted/sfo-spark-scroll-animation.git"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"spark-carousel"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"git@bitbucket.org:redacted/sfo-spark-carousel.git#~2.2.1"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"spark-object-fit"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"git@bitbucket.org:redacted/sfo-spark-object-fit.git"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"spark-on-swipe"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"git@bitbucket.org:redacted/sfo-spark-on-swipe.git#~2.0.3"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"spark-responsive-images"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"git@bitbucket.org:redacted/sfo-spark-responsive-images.git#~0.1.5"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"spark-video"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"git@bitbucket.org:redacted/sfo-spark-video.git"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n  <span class="token string">"spark-share"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"git@bitbucket.org:redacted/sfo-spark-share.git"</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This was okay for some of the work Odopod did, but as a mostly frontend studio, we often deliver code to other companies. It also made continuous integration and Heroku deployments more difficult because they needed a SSH key with access to the repos. I spent some time writing a Heroku buildpack that added a SSH key from an environment variable and then installed bower components.</p>\n<h2>üî§ Naming things</h2>\n<p>The technology group at Odopod tried our best to come up with a great name which the lawyers were okay with, which took over a year. My favorite was <strong>Podium</strong>, but unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt approved. We decided none of the approved names were that great, so we called it the Code Library and prefixed all the packages with <code class="language-text">odo-</code>. Naming is hard üòÖ.</p>\n<h2>üì¶ GitHub and npm</h2>\n<p>I <a href="https://github.com/odopod/code-library/">moved the repository to GitHub</a> as one large repository. We use <a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna">Lerna</a> to manage and publish all 31 odo packages to npm, which is much better than managing 30+ different repositories which all share dependencies.</p>\n<h2>üî¨ Behind the scenes</h2>\n<p>The components are written in ES2015+, compiled with Babel, and bundled with Rollup. Unit tests are run in a headless Chrome browser with Karma using Mocha and Chai. Code coverage is collected by Istanbul, while Gulp runs all these tasks.</p>\n<h2>üöÄ Release</h2>\n<p>On August 2, 2017 <a href="https://www.odopod.com/news/code-library">we made the Odopod Code Library public</a> üéâ.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôd like to contribute, you‚Äôll find all the components on <a href="https://github.com/odopod/code-library">GitHub</a>. Each one is published on npm under the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/org/odopod">@odopod</a> organization.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Odopod Code Library",imageDescription:"Screenshot of the odopod code library directory page.",href:"https://code.odopod.com/",tags:["open source","components"]}},hero:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAIAAADwazoUAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAACA0lEQVQoz02Pa2sTQRSG8wNtstlExGSTSe+tveXaNoEi4geLoFJQUBEU+9k/IhQK1daaVkuVYG1z33R3Zi+Ps00/OLzMnDlzHt53YjQSbBrUTeppqgZlg4pJNU0pSdFk1WQtzYrJkslikkWTBZN5k7kUs6kYm0mqE7zc4NNrdp/xfpuPz3n1kHdP2N1hZ4sPL3izzdunPC4xHWcuzUwq0rSGa9rKYP0u9ftsCeo51rNU7lGzqFqUs5QtinoXFPNMJyNsKsVkioKGNVlK0LB4NEsjT13QKLCeo5aPsEqeosVajqUMU8b/JELDqxMs32Ejy9YMNe2ZoZxhPs5snJk4UwkmExQSCC2DvEHOwDLIJskk9Z8tNnRUHTJLLXcTNUdFUNKegjXBqmBFsCxYEjwQLAoWBPMF5goxXEdLDgfhoB922vT7yh76I1s3Q/0k3UiuG41JJyqkO0a0YtwsGfjuteu7KgwCLwyl50vlKy9wlbQdR/q+CkJ99Xzv2nH0wJiKhTfV1WV77/Bzs3XmBVG31+3vH+4dnB78al2221f20D48/vrl5/5+8/zPxV+l1C08Pnqd3snvb83Wj27fDgJ/OLCb58fNVvOyM/Q8JaU6PTv53jo6Or/w/ECnG1vewspTyvU8qaTrjkbXtm33ev1uu9vrdnSt26Oo6zgju9NpDwaDMfUPpQz2i6nZ4KIAAAAASUVORK5CYII=",aspectRatio:1.7776983559685489,src:"/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-982a9.png",srcSet:"/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-f8f73.png 640w,\n/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-357c9.png 1280w,\n/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-982a9.png 2487w",srcWebp:"/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-cea1a.webp",srcSetWebp:"/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-f1080.webp 640w,\n/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-a2f45.webp 1280w,\n/static/odopod-code-library-5c490ff7ba59e4ff0f9310264259a905-cea1a.webp 2487w",sizes:"(max-width: 2487px) 100vw, 2487px"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/odopod-code-library/",heroImage:"/images/odopod-code-library.png/",nextProject:{frontmatter:{title:"odopod.com"},fields:{slug:"/odopod-com/"}}}}}});
