# Hey it's the work I've done.

> My portfolio of work.

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site. Gatsby is a static site generator for React. Components are written in React with GraphQL and project pages are written in markdown. Gatsby takes care of development environment, bundling, code-splitting, and more. I use some Gatsby plugins for images, markdown, and code syntax highlighting.

## Running locally

Install the Gatsby CLI

```shell
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Then run the `develop` command.

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Now visit [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) to see the site.
