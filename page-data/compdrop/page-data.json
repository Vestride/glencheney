Just drag and drop your images into the browser.</p>\n<h2>Improving the workflow</h2>\n<p>For design reviews, designers at Odopod would export their Photoshop files to jpgs (called ”<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_layout\">comps</a>”) on our internal server. They then gathered in a meeting room and pulled up the images in Preview.app to critique the work. In 2013, one of the developers built <a href=\"http://cmpdrp.com\">cmpdrp.com</a> as a drag-n-drop preview of the designs that automatically scaled them to actual size, showed the designs within a browser’s chrome, and allowed clicking through them.</p>\n<h2>PWA all the things!</h2>\n<p>Late in 2017 I had some idle time and really wanted to do something with Vue and TypeScript. I decided to rebuild the comp drop app, make it a <abbr title=\"Progressive Web App\">PWA</abbr>, and add some new features to it.</p>\n<p>I started off the project with a <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs-templates/pwa\">Vue PWA scaffold</a> and added TypeScript to it. The PWA template handled all the service worker caching and offline needs and I started building the new Compdrop.</p>\n<h2>New features</h2>\n<p>After soliciting feedback from the designers and watching how they used the old compdrop, I began to add new features to the app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropping a directory of images on the page instead of selecting all within a directory.</li>\n<li>Retina image scaling for designs done at 2x size.</li>\n<li>Added a mode which allowed images to be scrolled.</li>\n<li>New keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li>Added support for “collections”. Designers used to open multiple tabs of cmpdrp, one for each person to show their work. Now when they drop multiple directories in, Compdrop creates a collection for each one.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->\n<video muted playsinline controls loop poster=\"/compdrop-poster.png\">\n  <source src=\"/static/f33d1706394acee134f127fb99856838/compdrop.webm\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis\">\n  <source src=\"/static/a28c30c6b3bdf4fa74f0e770a8607fe3/compdrop.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<h2>Thoughts on Vue</h2>\n<p>Vue was nice to use, but it feels a little too “automagic” for my liking. Using the <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component\"><code class=\"language-text\">vue-class-component</code></a> decorator was also enjoyable because I was accustomed to components in React. Vuex, the state management library for Vue, was very nice to use and easier for me to grok than Redux.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Compdrop","imageDescription":"Screenshot of the compdrop app without any files added yet.","shortDescription":"Compdrop is a drag and drop web app to view website designs in the browser.","href":"https://compdrop.io/","tags":["open source","drag-n-drop","TypeScript","Vue","PWA"]}},"hero":{"id":"91c4192e-683b-507e-b459-ff23e44a9553","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.777434312210201,"src":"/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/54967/compdrop-hero.png","srcSet":"/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/a5370/compdrop-hero.png 350w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/73c85/compdrop-hero.png 700w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/54967/compdrop-hero.png 1400w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/c3ed8/compdrop-hero.png 2100w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/b7291/compdrop-hero.png 2300w","srcWebp":"/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/9592d/compdrop-hero.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/8ea22/compdrop-hero.webp 350w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/47203/compdrop-hero.webp 700w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/9592d/compdrop-hero.webp 1400w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/90b9d/compdrop-hero.webp 2100w,\n/static/2379aaff8b24f4dcbda743317f8e2fc4/62d71/compdrop-hero.webp 2300w","sizes":"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/compdrop/","heroImage":"compdrop-hero.png","nextProject":{"frontmatter":{"title":"cssnano"},"fields":{"slug":"/cssnano-minifier/"}}}}}
